# Authentication Endpoints Security Strategy

This document outlines the security strategy for authentication endpoints in the API Gateway, explaining how the specific token handling improvements align with the Product Requirements Document (PRD).

## Relationship to PRD

The authentication endpoint security improvements support the following sections of the PRD:

### 1. Basic Security Hardening (Phase 1: Critical Security)

From the PRD:
> - Audit current routes for security gaps
> - Ensure consistent application of security filters
> - Test and verify role-based access

Our token handling improvements directly address security gaps in the current implementation and ensure consistent application of security filters.

### 2. Enhanced Security (MVP APIs and Integrations)

From the PRD:
> - Complete existing AWS Cognito integration
> - Implement role-based authorization filters
> - Apply appropriate security to all routes

Our improvements ensure appropriate security is applied to authentication endpoints, which are the foundation of the entire security system.

## OAuth 2.0 Best Practices Implementation

We are standardizing our authentication endpoints following OAuth 2.0 best practices:

1. **API Access Endpoints** (GET/verification operations):
   - Use Authorization header with Bearer token scheme
   - Examples: `/verify`, API resource access endpoints

2. **Data-Changing Operations** (POST/DELETE operations):
   - Use request body for token submission
   - Examples: `/sign-out` (or `/sessions` with DELETE), `/refresh`

3. **Security Headers Implementation**:
   - Adding standard security headers to all responses
   - Implementing CSRF protection
   - Configuring proper cache control

## Implementation Tasks

The implementation is divided into the following tasks:

1. **Task #11**: Standardize RESTful API naming conventions
   - Rename `/login` to `/sessions` (POST)
   - Rename `/verify` to `/token-validation` (GET)
   - Rename `/refresh` to `/tokens/refresh` (POST)
   - Rename `/sign-out` to `/sessions` (DELETE)
   - Rename `/admin/user/create` to `/admin-users` (POST)
   - Apply proper HTTP status codes (201, 204)

2. **Task #13**: Overall security enhancement framework
   - Defines the broader security strategy
   - Establishes standards for token handling
   - Implements cross-cutting concerns (CSRF, rate limiting)

3. **Task #17**: Update `/verify` endpoint
   - Move token from request body to Authorization header
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add security headers

4. **Task #18**: Update `/sign-out` endpoint
   - Move tokens from headers to request body
   - Implement proper token revocation
   - Update to RESTful naming (`/sessions` with DELETE)

## Security Benefits

This standardized approach provides several security benefits:

1. **Consistency**: All endpoints follow the same standards, making the API easier to secure and audit
2. **Compliance**: Alignment with OAuth 2.0 standards improves interoperability and security
3. **Protection**: Proper token handling reduces risks of token interception or leakage
4. **Defense-in-depth**: Multiple security layers including CSRF protection, rate limiting, and security headers

## Testing Approach

The security improvements will be validated through:

1. Comprehensive unit and integration testing
2. Security-specific tests for CSRF, token handling, and rate limiting
3. API contract validation to ensure backward compatibility
4. Security audits and automated vulnerability scanning

This approach ensures our authentication endpoint security aligns with industry best practices while supporting the broader security goals outlined in the PRD.
