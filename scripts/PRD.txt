# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
1. **Microservice Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Managing distributed services adds complexity to development and operations.
   - **Mitigation**: Strong service boundaries, comprehensive API documentation, and centralized monitoring.

2. **Data Consistency**
   - **Risk**: Maintaining consistency across services during transactions (e.g., ticket purchases).
   - **Mitigation**: Implement event-driven architecture with idempotent operations and transaction sagas.

3. **Scalability Under Load**
   - **Risk**: System performance during high-demand events (flash sales, popular events).
   - **Mitigation**: Load testing, distributed caching, and auto-scaling configurations.

## MVP Scope Management
1. **Feature Creep**
   - **Risk**: Adding too many features before establishing core functionality.
   - **Mitigation**: Strict prioritization based on user value, regular scope reviews.

2. **Technical Debt**
   - **Risk**: Taking shortcuts to deliver MVP features that will require substantial rework later.
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain code quality standards, plan for refactoring in subsequent phases.

3. **User Adoption Barriers**
   - **Risk**: Complex workflows that discourage user adoption.
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on simplicity for core user flows, usability testing throughout development.

## Resource Constraints
1. **Development Bandwidth**
   - **Risk**: Limited development resources to implement all desired features.
   - **Mitigation**: Clear prioritization, modular development approach, potential use of third-party solutions.

2. **Specialized Expertise**
   - **Risk**: Need for specialized skills in areas like payment processing or security.
   - **Mitigation**: Targeted training, partnership with specialized service providers, or strategic hiring.

3. **Infrastructure Costs**
   - **Risk**: Cloud infrastructure costs as the platform scales.
   - **Mitigation**: Efficient resource usage, cost monitoring, and optimization of high-cost services.
