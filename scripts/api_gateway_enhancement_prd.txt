# Overview  
The API Gateway is a critical component of the Gotik platform, serving as the single entry point for all client requests. While the current implementation provides basic routing, load balancing, and integration with authentication services, several enhancements are needed to fully meet the requirements specified in the system PRD, particularly in the areas of authorization, performance monitoring, and resilience under high load.

# Core Features  
1. **API Gateway Routing and Load Balancing**
   - Routes client requests to appropriate microservices
   - Implements client-side load balancing for distributed services
   - Provides a unified access point for frontend applications

2. **Security and Access Control**
   - Integrates with authentication services (AWS Cognito)
   - Enforces authorization policies based on user roles
   - Implements rate limiting to prevent abuse

3. **Request Processing**
   - Handles request and response transformation
   - Provides logging and monitoring
   - Supports cross-cutting concerns like CORS and header enrichment

# User Experience  
## User Personas

1. **Application Developers**
   - Need a reliable API gateway to route requests to appropriate services
   - Require clear documentation on routing rules and security policies
   - Depend on gateway stability for application functionality

2. **System Administrators**
   - Monitor gateway performance and health
   - Configure routing rules and security policies
   - Respond to incidents and performance issues

3. **End Users** 
   - Experience consistent authentication across all services
   - Receive appropriate authorization for their role
   - Benefit from reliable system performance even during high traffic periods

## Key User Flows

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - User provides credentials to the gateway
   - Gateway validates with the authentication service
   - User receives a token for subsequent requests

2. **Service Request Flow**
   - User sends authenticated request to the gateway
   - Gateway validates the token and checks authorization
   - Request is routed to the appropriate service, and response is returned

3. **Error Handling Flow**
   - When errors occur, appropriate status codes and messages are returned
   - System gracefully degrades under extreme load
   - Rate limiting is applied when necessary to maintain system stability

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clear error messages for developers and end users
- Consistent response formatting across all services
- Minimal latency for optimal user experience
